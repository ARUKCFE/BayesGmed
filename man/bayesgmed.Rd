\arguments{
\item{outcome}{a character string indicating the name of the outcome variable.}

\item{mediator}{a character string indicating the name of the mediator variable.}

\item{treat}{a character string indicating the name of the treatment variable. The treatment can be either binary (integer or a two-valued factor) or continuous (numeric).}

\item{covariates}{a character vector indicating the name of the confounding variables.}

\item{dist.y}{a character string indicating the family distribution of the outcome.  E.g., dist.y = "bernoulli" will fit
a logistic regression the outcome.}

\item{dist.m}{a character string indicating the family distribution of the mediator  E.g., dist.m = "bernoulli" will fit
a logistic regression the mediator}

\item{link.y}{a character string indicating the link function to be used for the outcome model.}

\item{link.m}{a character string indicating the link function to be used for the mediator model.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or a \code{tibble} object.}

\item{control.value}{The vaue of the treatment variable to be used as a reference level.}

\item{treat.value}{The vaue of the treatment variable to be used as a treatment level.}

\item{priors}{A list of named values to be used as the prior scale parameters. See details.}

\item{...}{Other optional parameters passed to \code{rstan::stan()}.}

\value{
An object of S4 class stanfit, with all its available methods.

\description{
Estimates a Bayesian causal mediation model using g-formula approach though Stan.
}
\details{
Bayesgmed is the main function for estimating causal mediation effects
from several types of data with in the Bayesian framework. We followed the potential
outcome framework for effects definition and the package uses the rstan utility functions
for exploring the posterior distribution.
\subsection{priors}{

Users may pass a list of named values for the priors argument. The values will be used to define
the scale parameter of the respective prior distributions. This list may specify some or all of the
following parameters:
priors <- list(
scale_m = 2.5, scale_y = 2.5,
location_m = 0, location_y = 0,
scale_sd_y = 2.5, scale_sd_m = 2.5)
}
